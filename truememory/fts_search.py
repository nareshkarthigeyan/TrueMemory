"""
TrueMemory FTS5 Search Module
============================

Full-text search powered by SQLite FTS5 with BM25 ranking and score
normalization. Provides the keyword-search layer of the TrueMemory hybrid
retrieval pipeline (L3 Semantic layer uses FTS5 + vector + RRF fusion).

Key design decisions:
    - Safe query handling: all queries are sanitized (quoted + OR-joined)
      before use as FTS5 MATCH expressions to prevent syntax injection.
    - Score normalization: BM25 raw scores (negative, more negative = better)
      are flipped and scaled to 0-1 where 1.0 = most relevant result.
    - Time and sender filtering happen in SQL (not post-hoc) where possible,
      with FTS5 providing the candidate set.
