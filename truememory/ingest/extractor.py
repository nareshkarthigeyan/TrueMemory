"""
Fact Extractor
==============

LLM-based atomic fact extraction from conversation transcripts.
This is "deep processing" (Craik & Lockhart, 1972) — extracting meaning
and connections, not just surface text. Deeper processing produces
stronger, more retrievable memories.

Extracts:
- Personal facts (name, location, age, job, relationships)
- Preferences (likes, dislikes, style choices, tool preferences)
- Decisions (chose X over Y, committed to Z)
- Corrections (user corrected a previous assumption)
- Temporal facts (events with dates, deadlines, plans)
- Technical context (architecture decisions, configs, stack choices)

Each fact is atomic — one clear statement per fact. This mirrors how
the hippocampus encodes individual episodes rather than entire experiences.

- Relationship details (who someone is, how they relate to others)

DO NOT EXTRACT:
- Transient debugging details (error messages, stack traces, temp fixes)
- Code snippets or implementation specifics (those live in the codebase)
- Greetings, pleasantries, filler ("hey", "sounds good", "thanks")
- Things obvious from the codebase or git history
- The assistant's own suggestions or explanations (only USER-stated facts)

For each fact, provide:

  Good: "Prefers bun over npm"

- "category": One of: personal, preference, decision, correction, temporal, technical, relationship
- "confidence": high, medium, or low
- "source_role": "user" (stated by user) or "inferred" (implied by context)
