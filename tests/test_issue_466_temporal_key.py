"""Regression tests for issue #466: temporal key name mismatch.

engine.py:1429 checks intent.get("start_date") and intent.get("end_date")
but detect_temporal_intent() returns "after" and "before".  This causes
temporal cross-source feedback (A1 rescoping) to be silently skipped,
meaning temporally-scoped FTS results never merge into the final results.
