"""Regression tests for issues #487 and #488: entity boost scale-awareness
and salience filter ordering.

Issue #487 (H1): Entity boost in search is scale-unaware.
    A flat +0.3 boost is added to RRF scores that are typically ~0.015,
    creating ~21x amplification. The entity boost must be proportional
    to the score range.

Issue #488 (H2): Salience filtering happens BEFORE entity boosting.
    Low-salience entity-relevant results are discarded before the boost
    can rescue them. The filter must run AFTER entity boosting.
