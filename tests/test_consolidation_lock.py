"""Regression locks for #401 — build_summaries must not hold the SQLite write
lock during its (30-60s) salience/sentence computation.

Pre-fix: build_summaries ran `DELETE FROM summaries` first, then did all the
per-month/per-entity scoring inside that open write transaction, committing
only at the end. The exclusive write lock was held for the whole computation,
so any concurrent writer failed with "database is locked" once the 10s
busy_timeout elapsed.

Fix: compute all rows first (reads only, no write transaction), then do
DELETE + executemany(INSERT) + commit in one short transaction (rollback on
error). The write lock is held only for the fast bulk write.
